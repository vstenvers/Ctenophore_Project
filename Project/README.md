# Folder: Project, Comparative study of Ctenophore phylogeny

*Authors: S. Koning and V. Stenvers*

*Purpose: Compare ctenophore phylogenies, based on two different genes.*

Choosing molecular markers for phylogenetic studies can be challenging, as different markers will produce different phylogenetic relationships. The aim of this program is to compare ctenophore phylogeny, based on a highly common marker (18s rRNA) and a rather unusual one (putative isopenicillin-N-synthase). Additionally, both markers are combined to investigate the strength of multiple-marker phylogenies. **NB** It should be noted that comparing genes from different samples/studies is biologically incorrect and can only be justified for the purpose of this exercise.

The project is organised as follows:
1. The putative isopenicillin-N-synthase genes from NCBI (Francis et al. 2015, Plos ONE)
2. Download 18s rRNA sequences from NCBI
3. Match sequences from both markers (i.e. to create two trees based on the same number of species)
4. Build maximum likelihood (ML) trees based on both markers
5. Combine both markers and again build a ML tree
